== Implementation

The implementation of the social media trending topics scraper app will involve setting up the backend, frontend, and the necessary GCP services. Here is a step-by-step guide:

=== Backend Setup (Golang on PCF)

1. *Set up Golang Environment*: Configure the Go environment on PCF.
2. *Scraping Service Development*: Develop the scraping service in Go to fetch data from designated websites.
3. *Database Integration*: Connect the service to both SQL and NoSQL databases for data storage.
4. *Scheduling Mechanism*: Implement a scheduler (like a cron job) for periodic scraping.
5. *Message Queue Setup*: Configure GCP Pub/Sub for managing scraping tasks.

=== Frontend Setup (React)

1. *Set up React Environment*: Create a React application optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
2. *Frontend-Backend Communication*: Establish communication between the frontend and the backend services using RESTful APIs or GraphQL.
3. *UI Development*: Develop user interfaces for displaying the trending topics.

=== GCP Services Integration

1. *Cloud Storage Configuration*: Set up GCP Cloud Storage for additional data storage needs, if required.
2. *Caching Implementation*: Implement a caching solution, potentially using GCP's Memorystore or a similar service.
3. *Monitoring and Logging*: Utilize GCP's monitoring and logging tools for maintaining application health and performance.

=== Testing and Deployment

1. *Unit and Integration Testing*: Conduct thorough testing of both backend and frontend components.
2. *Deployment*: Deploy the application on PCF on GCP, ensuring all services are properly configured and integrated.
3. *Performance Tuning*: Monitor the application's performance and make necessary adjustments for optimization.

=== Post-Deployment

1. *Continuous Monitoring*: Regularly monitor the application for any issues or performance bottlenecks.
2. *User Feedback*: Collect user feedback for future improvements.
3. *Update and Maintenance*: Periodically update the application and maintain the infrastructure.
