# Social Media Trending Topics Scraper

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an application for scraping and analyzing trending topics on social media platforms. Leveraging Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services and hosted on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), it utilizes Golang for backend development and combines SQL and NoSQL databases. This application serves as a showcase of cloud functionalities like web scraping, data storage, and cloud-native application development.

## Key Features and Requirements
- **Functional Requirements**: The application will scrape websites aggregating social media trends and display this data via a React-based user interface. It includes a backend process for periodic, autonomous scraping.
- **Technical Requirements**: Deployment on PCF on GCP, backend development in Golang, use of SQL and NoSQL databases, scheduled scraping jobs, message queue integration (e.g., GCP Pub/Sub), and implementation of caching mechanisms for performance.

## Architecture and Methods
The application's architecture includes a backend service developed in Golang and a frontend UI in React. It encompasses data flow management, database utilization, and external service integration, focusing on a structured approach to data processing.

## Implementation Approach
The implementation process is divided into stages: setting up the environment, developing scraping functionality, designing the UI, database integration, and GCP services utilization. This step-by-step method ensures an efficient development process.

## Milestones
A timeline is established with key phases like initial setup, feature development, and testing. This timeline ensures a structured and time-bound approach to the project, with specific target dates for each phase.

## Results Gathering and Evaluation
The final phase involves evaluating the application's functionality, performance, user experience, and technical integration. This assessment will guide future enhancements and improvements to the application.
